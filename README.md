### Hello World :earth_americas:, My name is Geiciane! ðŸ‘‹ Nice to virtually meet you!

:brazil:

I am a Full Stack Web Developer in the Triangle Area (Raleigh - NC) with a Bachelorâ€™s Degree and 2+ years of professional experience in teaching English as a second language. I am a great communicator who works very well on a team, balancing communication with great listening skills. 
I am a curious person who loves learning new things, a hard worker who sticks with the work until it is done, and someone who loves traveling and cultures.
