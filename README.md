### Hello World :earth_americas:, My name is Geiciane! ðŸ‘‹ Nice to virtually meet you! 	:smiley:




I am a Full Stack Web Developer in the Triangle Area (Raleigh - NC) with a Bachelorâ€™s Degree and 2+ years of professional experience in teaching English as a second language. I am a great communicator who works very well on a team, balancing communication with great listening skills. 
I am a curious person who loves learning new things, a hard worker who keeps working until the job is done, and someone who loves traveling and experiencing different cultures.
